IECSE Summer Web Project 2020


## Welcome to Summer Web '20!

The project is based on the following base course + electives structure. The base course will help you towards building a basic foundation in backend and frontend development for web. After the two week course is done, you're supposed to pick electives that you would like to continue your learning with. Once you are done with an elective, you will move on to the next one.

The Base Course will include Vanilla JS, Node.Js and React.
